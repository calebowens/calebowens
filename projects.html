Most of my projects are based around fullstack based technologies but I enjoy trying all sorts of different experiments in much different patterns of programming.</p></section><section class="projects-container"><div><div class="header"><div class="title"><h2>Number Pad Keyboard</h2><p>Ruby, Embedded Controller</p></div></div><p><my>num pad project was to build a number key pad that I could use for playing</my><classing>rouge-like video games which require a number pad, which unfortunately</classing><my>keyboard doesn't have. Thus I used one of my new Raspberry Pi Pico</my><microcontrollers>with a matrix of switches to build a number pad. I had</microcontrollers><designed>and had laser cut a "plate" in which a flat peice of acrylic plastic</designed><which>the key switches slot into. I programmed the pad in Ruby and it communicates</which><to>my computer over a USB connection.</to></p></div><div><div class="header"><div class="title"><h2>Splashes</h2><p>Laravel, JS, React</p></div><img src="/splashes_icon.99b5b76c.svg"></div><p>Splashes is a web page builder that lets you build blog posts, or share small information leaflets with others. I built it using Laravel, JS, SCSS, and React. The choice of laravel as my framework of choice was to help expand my knowledge of the technology as I've been using it at work and I wanted to increase my knowledge of it and become more proficient in it. After completing the project I feel like I've improved my Laravel proficiency and have created a cool app to show for it.</p></div><div><div class="header"><div class="title"><h2>Resolution Tracker</h2><p>CoffeeScript, Firebase, React Native</p></div><img src="/resolution_tracker_icon.8d2af625.svg"></div><p>Resolution Tracker is an app that I'm working on which will let you track a particular habit you want to form. For example, if you wanted to start running in the morning, you could create a daily tracker, and you would be able to check off a button each day you go running. I've chosen to build it in React Native with expo so I can target mobile and web. I'm going for a Mobile First approach as to try and target wider audiences on their prefered platform.</p></div><div><div class="header"><div class="title"><h2>Twilight Peaks</h2><p>Ruby, Firestore, Discord.js</p></div><img src="/twilight_peaks_icon.34747827.svg"></div><p><twilight>Peaks is an MMORPG that I've been working on to help me learn ruby</twilight><it>a public facing API with the idea being that any player of the game can</it><write>a client that suits their way of game play. With the restriction on gameplay</write><being>that every action needs to happen in a transaction, I'm going to have</being><the>game focused on interactions with game characters and items in the world</the><with>less emphasis on player verses enemy conflicts.
