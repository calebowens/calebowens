        Here is a curation of my own personal projects, complete and in progress.
         Most of my projects are based around fullstack based technologies but
         I enjoy trying all sorts of different experiments in much different patterns
         of programming.

      +project('Number Pad Keyboard', 'Ruby, Embedded Controller', '')
        My num pad project was to build a number key pad that I could use for playing
        classing rouge-like video games which require a number pad, which unfortunately
        my keyboard doesn't have. Thus I used one of my new Raspberry Pi Pico
        microcontrollers with a matrix of switches to build a number pad. I had
        designed and had laser cut a "plate" in which a flat peice of acrylic plastic
        which the key switches slot into. I programmed the pad in Ruby and it communicates
        to my computer over a USB connection.
      +project('Splashes', 'Laravel, JS, React', 'https://splashes.cc', './assets/splashes_icon.svg').
        Splashes is a web page builder that lets you build blog posts, or share
        small information leaflets with others. I built it using Laravel, JS,
        SCSS, and React. The choice of laravel as my framework of choice was to
        help expand my knowledge of the technology as I've been using it at work
        and I wanted to increase my knowledge of it and become more proficient in it.
        After completing the project I feel like I've improved my Laravel proficiency
        and have created a cool app to show for it.
      +project('Resolution Tracker', 'CoffeeScript, Firebase, React Native', '', './assets/resolution_tracker_icon.svg').
        Resolution Tracker is an app that I'm working on which will let you track
        a particular habit you want to form. For example, if you wanted to start
        running  in the morning, you could create a daily tracker, and you would
        be able to check off a button each day you go running. I've chosen to build
        it in React Native with expo so I can target mobile and web. I'm going for
        a Mobile First approach as to try and target wider audiences on their prefered
        platform.
      +project('Twilight Peaks', 'Ruby, Firestore, Discord.js', '', './assets/twilight_peaks_icon.svg')
        Twilight Peaks is an MMORPG that I've been working on to help me learn ruby
        it a public facing API with the idea being that any player of the game can
        write a client that suits their way of game play. With the restriction on gameplay
        being that every action needs to happen in a transaction, I'm going to have
        the game focused on interactions with game characters and items in the world
        with less emphasis on player verses enemy conflicts. To make the game accessible
        to a wider audiences however, I'm going to build a chat bot that wraps the game
        API for the messaging service Discord through the Discord.js library.
